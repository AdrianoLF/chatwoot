With just one click, you can execute a series of predefined actions, such as labeling a conversation, sending an email transcript, or updating custom attributes. This streamlines workflows, boosts productivity, and ensures consistency in actions.</p><p> Plus, macros can be a lifesaver when onboarding new team members. Instead of explaining each step, managers and team leads can simply point to the macros used in different scenarios, saving time and effort.</p> <p> You can manage your macros from this page or create new ones using the 'Add macro' button.</p><p>Open the Macros handbook in another tab for a helping hand.</p>",
